# API Reference

VIIPER ships a lightweight TCP API (not REST) for managing virtual buses/devices and for device-specific streaming. It’s designed to be trivial to drive from any language that can open a TCP socket and send newline-terminated commands.

## Protocol overview

- Transport: TCP
- Default listen address: `:3242` (configurable via `--api.addr`)
- Request format: a single ASCII/UTF‑8 line terminated by `\n`
- Routing: first token is the path (e.g. `bus/list`), remaining tokens are arguments (space-separated)
- Success response: a single line containing a JSON payload (or an empty line for commands that have no payload)
- Error response: a single line JSON object `{ "error": "message" }`

Tip: You can experiment with `nc`/`ncat` or PowerShell’s `tcpclient` to send lines and read JSON back.

!!! warning "Connection timing and auto‑cleanup"
    After you add a device with `bus/{id}/add`, you must connect to its streaming endpoint within the configured `DeviceHandlerConnectTimeout` (default: 5s). If no stream connection is established in time, the device is automatically removed. Likewise, when a stream disconnects, a reconnection timer with the same timeout starts; if the client doesn’t reconnect before it expires, the device is removed.

## Commands

The server registers the following commands and streams:

- `bus/list`
    - List all virtual bus IDs.
    - Response: `{ "buses": [1, 2, ...] }`

- `bus/create [busId]`
    - Create a new bus. If `busId` is provided, VIIPER attempts to create the bus with that id; otherwise it picks the next free id.
    - Response: `{ "busId": <id> }`

- `bus/remove <busId>`
    - Remove a bus and all devices on it.
    - Response: `{ "busId": <id> }`

- `bus/{id}/list`
    - List devices on a bus.
    - Response: `{ "devices": [{ "busId": 1, "devId": "1", "vid": "0x045e", "pid": "0x028e", "type": "xbox360" }, ...] }`

- `bus/{id}/add <deviceType>`
    - Add a device to a bus. `deviceType` is a registered device name (e.g., `xbox360`).
    - Response: `{ "id": "<busId>-<devId>" }` where the id is the USBIP busid string you will attach to.
    - Important: After add, the server starts a connect timer (default `5s`). You must open a device stream (see below) before the timeout expires, otherwise the device is auto-removed.

- `bus/{id}/remove <deviceId>`
    - Remove a device by its device number on that bus (the part after the dash in the busid string).
    - Response: `{ "busId": <id>, "devId": "<dev>" }`

### Streaming endpoint

- Path: `bus/{busId}/{deviceid}`
- Type: long-lived TCP connection (no line protocol once established)
- Purpose: device-specific, bidirectional stream. The API server hands the socket to the device’s registered stream handler.
- Timeout behavior: When a stream ends, a reconnect timer is started (same `DeviceHandlerConnectTimeout`). If the client doesn’t reconnect in time, the device is removed.

#### Xbox 360 controller stream (device type: `xbox360`)

Direction: client ➜ server (input state)

- Fixed 14-byte packets, little-endian layout:
    - `Buttons` uint32 (4 bytes)
    - `LT` uint8, `RT` uint8 (2 bytes)
    - `LX, LY, RX, RY` int16 each (8 bytes)

Direction: server ➜ client (rumble)

- Fixed 2-byte packets:
    - `LeftMotor` uint8, `RightMotor` uint8

See `pkg/device/xbox360/protocol.go` for full details.

#### HID keyboard stream (device type: `keyboard`)

Direction: client ➜ server (keys pressed)

- Variable-length packets per frame:
    - Header: Modifiers uint8, KeyCount uint8
    - Body: KeyCount bytes of HID Usage IDs for currently pressed (non-modifier) keys

Direction: server ➜ client (LED state)

- 1-byte packets whenever host LED state changes:
    - Bit 0 NumLock, Bit 1 CapsLock, Bit 2 ScrollLock

Host-facing HID input report is 34 bytes: [Modifiers (1), Reserved (1), 256-bit key bitmap (32)].

See `pkg/device/keyboard/` for helpers and constants.

#### HID mouse stream (device type: `mouse`)

Direction: client ➜ server (motion/buttons)

- Fixed 5-byte packets per frame:
    - Buttons uint8 (bits 0..4)
    - dX int8, dY int8
    - Wheel int8, Pan int8

Direction: server ➜ client

- None (mouse is input-only)

Note: Motion and wheel deltas are consumed after each IN report so movement is relative.

Note on protocol compatibility:

- The wire format is modeled after the XInput gamepad state (XINPUT_GAMEPAD) but is not byte‑for‑byte identical. Key differences:
    - Buttons are encoded as a 32‑bit little‑endian field (XInput uses a 16‑bit bitmask), making the packet 14 bytes instead of 12.
    - No header or framing: packets are fixed‑length and back‑to‑back on the TCP stream.
    - Endianness is little‑endian for all multi‑byte fields.

## Example sessions

### Using netcat (Linux/macOS)

```bash
# List buses
printf "bus/list\n" | nc localhost 3242

# Create a bus
printf "bus/create\n" | nc localhost 3242
# → {"busId":1}

# Add a virtual Xbox 360 controller to bus 1
printf "bus/1/add xbox360\n" | nc localhost 3242
# → {"id":"1-1"}

# List devices on bus 1
printf "bus/1/list\n" | nc localhost 3242
```

Then, open a second TCP connection for streaming to `bus/1/1` (the API port, not the USBIP port). You’ll write 14‑byte input packets and read 2‑byte rumble packets. Any language with raw TCP support works.

### WIndows (PowerShell)

VIIPER includes convenience scripts for quick testing and automation:

```powershell
# Source the script to load helper functions
. .\scripts\viiper-api.ps1

# Use the Invoke-ViiperApi function (or 'viiper' alias)
viiper "bus/list"
viiper "bus/create"
viiper "bus/1/add xbox360" -Port 3242 -Hostname localhost
```

The script provides `Invoke-ViiperApi` (alias: `viiper`) for sending commands and `Connect-ViiperDevice` for testing persistent device connections.

### Go snippet (raw)

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "net"
)

func main() {
    conn, _ := net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:3242")
    defer conn.Close()
    fmt.Fprintln(conn, "bus/create")
    r := bufio.NewReader(conn)
    line, _ := r.ReadString('\n')
    fmt.Println(line) // {"busId":1}
}
```

For a higher-level experience, see the Go client in `pkg/apiclient/`.

## How this relates to USBIP

The API controls which virtual devices exist and exposes a device stream for live input/feedback. Separately, the USBIP server (default `:3241`) makes these devices attachable from clients. Typical flow:

1) Create a bus ➜ 2) Add a device ➜ 3) Connect the device stream ➜ 4) From a client, attach using USBIP by `busid` (see the Server command page for exact `usbip` syntax).
