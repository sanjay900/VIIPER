# VIIPER 🐍

**Virtual** **I**nput over **IP** **E**mulato**R**

VIIPER is a tool to create virtual input devices using USBIP.

## ℹ️ About VIIPER

VIIPER creates virtual USB input devices using the USBIP protocol.  
These virtual devices appear as real hardware to the operating system and applications, allowing you to emulate controllers, keyboards, and other input devices without physical hardware.

VIIPER is a self-contained, standalone binary that uses USBIP to handle the USB protocol layer.  
Device emulation happens in userspace code instead of kernel drivers, so no kernel programming is required to add new device types.  
Users need USBIP installed once (built into Linux, usbip-win2 for Windows), after that VIIPER runs without additional dependencies or system-wide installation.  
The binary is portable and can be bundled with your application.

Beyond device emulation, VIIPER can proxy real USB devices for traffic inspection and reverse engineering.

All devices _**can and must be**_ controlled programmatically via an API.

### ✨ Features

- ✅ Virtual input device emulation over IP using USBIP
  - ✅ Xbox 360 controller emulation (virtual device); see [Devices › Xbox 360 Controller](docs/devices/xbox360.md)
  - ✅ HID Keyboard with N-key rollover and LED feedback; see [Devices › Keyboard](docs/devices/keyboard.md)
  - ✅ HID Mouse with 5 buttons and horizontal/vertical wheel; see [Devices › Mouse](docs/devices/mouse.md)
  - 🔜 ???  
    🚧 Extensible architecture allows for more device types (other gamepads, specialized HID)
- ✅ USBIP server mode: expose virtual devices to remote clients
- ✅ **Automatic local attachment**: automatically controls usbip client on localhost to attach devices (enabled by default)
- ✅ Proxy mode: forward real USB devices and inspect/record traffic (for reversing)
- ✅ Cross-platform: works on Linux and Windows
- ✅ Flexible logging (including raw USB packet logs)
- ✅ API server for device/bus management and controlling virtual devices programmatically
- ✅ Multiple client SDKs (C, C#, Typescript/Javascript) for easy integration; see [Client SDKs](docs/api/overview.md)

## 🔌 Requirements

VIIPER is a standalone binary that requires USBIP.

**Linux:**

- **Arch Linux:**
  - Install: `sudo pacman -S usbip`
  - Docs: [Arch Wiki: USBIP](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB/IP)

- **Ubuntu:**  
  - Install: `sudo apt install linux-tools-generic`
  - Docs: [Ubuntu USBIP Manual](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man8/usbip.8.html)

**Windows:**

- [usbip-win2](https://github.com/vadimgrn/usbip-win2) is by far the most complete implementation of USBIP for Windows (comes with a **SIGNED** kernel mode driver).

## 🔌 API

VIIPER includes an  API for device and bus management, as well as streaming device control.  
Each device type exposes its own control interface via the API.

See the [API documentation](./docs/api) for details (🚧 in progress 🚧).

## 🛠️ Development

### 🧰 Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.25 or newer
- USBIP installed
- (Optional) [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
    - Linux/macOS: Usually pre-installed
    - Windows: `winget install ezwinports.make`


### 🔄 Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alia5/VIIPER.git
cd VIIPER
make build
```

The binary will be in `dist/viiper` (or `dist/viiper.exe` on Windows).

For more build options:
```bash
make help              # Show all available targets
make test              # Run tests
```

## ❓ FAQ

### What is USBIP and why does VIIPER use it?

USBIP is a protocol that allows USB devices to be shared over a network.  
VIIPER uses it because it's already built into Linux and available for Windows, making virtual device emulation possible without writing custom kernel drivers yourself.

### Can I use VIIPER for gaming?

Yes! VIIPER can create virtual controllers (currently only Xbox360) that appear as real hardware to games and applications.
This works with Steam, native Windows games, and any other application supporting controllers.

### How is VIIPER different from other controller emulators?

Most controller emulators require custom kernel drivers for each device type.  
VIIPER uses USBIP to handle the USB protocol layer, allowing device emulation in userspace without kernel drivers.  
This makes VIIPER portable, easier to extend, and simpler to bundle with applications.

### Can I add support for other device types?

Yes! VIIPER's architecture is designed to be extensible.  
Check the [xbox360 device implementation](.//device/xbox360/) as a reference for creating new device types.

### What about the proxy mode?

Proxy mode sits between a USBIP client and a USBIP server (like a Linux machine sharing real USB devices).  
VIIPER intercepts and logs all USB traffic passing through, without handling the devices directly.  
Useful for reverse engineering USB protocols and understanding how devices communicate.

### What about TCP overhead or input latency performance?

End-to-end input latency for virtual devices created with VIIPER is typically well below 1 millisecond on a modern desktop (e.g. Windows / Ryzen 3900X test machine).  
Detailed methodology and sample runs can be found in [E2E Latency Benchmarks](docs/testing/e2e_latency.md).
